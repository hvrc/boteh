## ?

Boteh is a browser based musical instrument combining hand gestures with a modular synthesizer. It uses your webcam to track hand movements and finger positions in a grid, converting gestures into musical notes and visual patterns. Each detected finger position triggers synthesizer sounds with parameters that can be modulated.
